# uruler

A computer rack ruler to assist with installing equipment.

Download the `uruler.png` image. Use a graphics viewer program to print it out.

IMPORTANT! You will need to
scale the image so when it prints out it is *exactly* ten and a half inches tall.

Now cut the image out and you have a `uruler`.

If you laminate the paper first before cutting this will make it more durable.

I have also seen the `uruler` stuck onto the front cover of a hardbacked notebook.

For the really dedicated stick it to a slim piece of plywood that
measures ten and a half inches tall by one and three quarter
inches wide.

## No need to run any code

The `uruler.png` image is ready to use. No need to run the `uruler.py` Python 3 program.

The `uruler.py` code is included
in the repositiory just in case anyone is curious as to how the `uruler.png` image was created. Spoiler alert: the
code isn't very pretty!

## Code details

The `uruler.png` image is created by running the `uruler.py` Python 3 program.

The `uruler.py` Python 3 program requires the Pillow module to be loaded. Something like:

```
pip install -U pillow
```

will necessary if you do not have the Pillow module installed.

The code is pretty rough and ready. It would make a good exercise for an
intermediate programmer to improve as part of a teaching class.

The improvements you should expect students to suggest/implement
could include:

+ Use a box drawing function that allows thickness to also be specified
+ Have a better way for the character bitmaps of the digits 1 through 6 to be represented
+ Add some comments!
